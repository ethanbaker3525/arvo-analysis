# Analyzing the Limitations of the Arvo Dataset

To set up the repository for analysis, first run `git clone https://github.com/n132/ARVO-Meta.git`.
To do dataset size analysis, run `python size.py`
To do dataset computation cost analysis, run `python cost.py`
To do dataset consistency analysis, run `python consistency.py`
Experiment data will be in `./data`. Some data was too large to upload to github, but it will be generated automatically.
A list of fully consistent ARVO ids is in `consistent_ids.json`
